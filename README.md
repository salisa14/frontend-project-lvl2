# Gendiff command
This command compares 2 files and shows the differences between them as a sting. You can use it as library for your own project or as command in terminal.
 
## You can install the project by running "make install" command 
To use it as a command in terminal run gendiff and paths to 2 files.
For example:
$ gendiff filepath1.json filepath2.json
